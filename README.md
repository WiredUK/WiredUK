Well hello there, thanks for stopping by!

My name is David and I have many hats. They include software engineer, geek, skeptic, [Skeptics in the Pub Online](https://sitp.online) organiser, somehow an [Ockham Award winner](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/about/the-ockham-awards/ockham-awards-2020/), and escape room enthusiast. I love to help people, which is why I am somehow in the top 0.14% on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663001/davidg?tab=profile).

I'd love to hear if you ever use any of my code, please drop me a message if you do!

My pronouns are he/him.
